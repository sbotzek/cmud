Glossary of terms:
- kud: a multiplayer text roleplaying game, where players can adventure together, explore the world, fighting monsters and finding treasure.
- koom: a location a player can be
- kone: a group of kooms centered around a larger place - such as a castle, church, forest, mountain, etc
- desc: description

Kooms are linked to eachother like a connected graph.  Players can move around them if they are linked together.  They do so by going in certain directions: north, south, east, west, up, down.

Each koom has these things:
- a koom id
- a koom title
- a koom desc
- a koom links desc

A koom desc must be 3 to 5 sentences long to describe the current koom.  Do not mention any details about the links here - that is only done in the links desc.  Do not mention anything related to weather or temperature.

A koom links desc should use a sentance or two to describe each other koom it is linked to.

A koom also has a 1 line season desc, which will be displayed with the regular desc.  A season desc should never mention the season.
- summer desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the koom in summer
- winter desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the koom in winter
- fall desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the koom in fall
- spring desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the koom in spring

Each link has these things:
- the first koom id, and the direction of travel to get there
- the second koom id, and the direction of travel to get there
- 0 or more link flags: door, hidden

These are the different types of link flags:
- hidden: this means the link is hidden from the player.  This is used for secrets.
- door: this means there is something players have to interact with before being able to go that direction.  Doors can be doors, gates, and also objects, such as a bush, tree, trapdoor, barrel, chest, etc.
- locked: if there's a door, it can be locked.

When outputting kooms, use the format:
ID:
Title:
Desc:
Links Desc:
Day Desc:
Night Desc:
Dawn Desc:
Dusk Desc:
Summer Desc:
Winter Desc:
Fall Desc:
Spring Desc:
<Direction> Link: <to koom id>, <link flags>

Build a kone with at least 30 kooms.  There shouldn't be more than 2 hidden links. It should be a vast mountain forest.

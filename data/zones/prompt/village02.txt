Glossary of terms:
- floig: a multiplayer text roleplaying game, where players can adventure together, explore the world, fighting monsters and finding treasure.
- zoit: a location a player can be
- noit: a group of zoits centered around a larger place - such as a castle, church, forest, mountain, etc
- desc: description

Players move around zoits.  They do so by going in certain directions: north, south, east, west, up, down.  Each zoit should be reachable by at least 1 or more zoits.  Most of the time, if zoit a is connected to zoit b, zoit b is also connected to zoit a.

An exit means there's a way to go a direction from the zoit to another zoit.  Since there are 6 directions, each zoit can have up to 6 exits.

Each zoit has these things:
- a zoit id
- a zoit title
- a zoit desc
- a zoit exits desc
- up to 6 exits

A zoit desc must be 3 to 5 sentences long to describe the current zoit.  You should not mention any details about the exits here - that is only done in the exits desc.

A zoit exits desc should use a sentance or two to describe each exit.

A zoit also has a 1 line season desc, which will be displayed with the regular desc.  A season desc should never mention the season.
- summer desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit in summer
- winter desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit in winter
- fall desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit in fall
- spring desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit in spring

A zoit also has a 1 line weather desc, which will be displayed with the regular desc
- rain desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit when it's raining
- snow desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit when it's snowing
- foggy desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit when it's foggy
- sunny desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit when it's sunny
- cloudy desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit when it's cloudy
- partly cloudy desc: a 1 sentence desc to add to the zoit when it's partly cloudy

A zoit also has a 1 line time-of-day desc, which will be displayed with the regular desc:
- day desc: a 1 sentence desc to add when its daytime
- night desc: a 1 sentence desc to add when its nighttime
- dusk desc: a 1 sentence desc to add when its dusk
- dawn desc: a 1 sentence desc to add when its dawn

Each exit has these things:
- the zoit id it leads to
- 0 or more exit flags: door, hidden

These are the different types of exit flags:
- hidden: this means the exit is hidden from the player.  This is used for secrets.
- door: this means there is something players have to interact with before being able to go that direction.  Doors can be doors, gates, and also objects, such as a bush, tree, trapdoor, barrel, chest, etc.
- locked: if there's a door, it can be locked.

When outputting zoits, use the format:

Winter Desc:
Fall Desc:

<Direction> Exit: <zoit id>, <exit flags>

Build a noit with at least 30 zoits.  Do not skip any zoits. It should be a small classical era fishing village.  The climate should be similar to San Jose, California.
